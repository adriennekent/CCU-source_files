<section><title>Description</title><p>The Assailants public goal
is the dominance of paranormals over normal humanity. However, Doctor
Bones is known to have other, secret, goals that take priority over
this task. The group seems to have been formed by Doctor Bones to
help him in his unknown ‘quest’. Some of the members are part of
the team by choice, while others seem to have had their minds altered by
Doctor Bones and are forced to act as a member of the team.</p></section>
<section><title>History</title><p>The first recorded action of the
Assailants was to demand the release of all known paranormals currently
in custody in the United States, Canada and Egypt. When the New
World Force attempted to track the Assailants down, the Assailants
detonated a nuclear.device aboard the U. S aircraft carrier, U.
S. S. Nimitz (which was at sea at the time), destroying the majority
of a carrier task force.</p><p>The Assailants have been blamed for
the massacre of the underwater city of Atlantis. The Assailants
made an elaborate scheme to capture Adamant and include him, after
proper conditioning, in the Assailants. They faked Adamant’s death
in order to cover their activities.</p><p>In July of 1997, the Assailants
began a campaign against the alien Horde who had established a base
in Brazil. They did this to acquire technology. They soundly routed
the New World Force and looted most of the base. Adamant was rescued
from the Assailants and was de programmed, but Cyber II was killed
in the line of duty. The Assailants were responsible for the creation
of a large number of Iraqi paranormals who raided Iran in October
of 1997. When the New World Force intervened, the Assailants didn’t
want to fight, so they destroyed the Iraqi Mutagenic Chamber and
retreated.</p><p>In February 1998, the Assailants made a decoy by
hijacking an airliner in Athens, Greece, while the majority of their
team attacked the World Force Headquarters in Berlin. The New World Force
was unprepared for this and failed to return to the headquarters
before the Assailants detonated a 5- kiloton nuclear device, destroying
everything within a mile radius of the headquarters. The New World
Force then discovered the reason for this attack was to obtain the
only surviving copy of Eric Dunn’s Underworld painting. The New
World Force tracked the Assailants to Tanzania, to the slopes of
Mt. Kilimanjaro. A fight ensued in which both Sculptress and Der
Totschlag were killed and Discobolo was captured. The rest of the
Assailants escaped. Soon afterwards, they destroyed their base on
the Dark Side of the Moon.</p><p>Doctor Bones was instrumental in
defeating the Horde Invasion fleet in November 1998. He had received
a coded signal from Cherub’s time bubble that gave him instructions
to remove a mental block placed in Cherub’s mind by a future incarnation
of Doctor Bones. Once the block was removed, Cherub fully remembered
the plan to destroy the Horde.</p><p>Following the Horde Invasion,
the Assailants went underground for awhile, but they reappeared
in Arcadia in late 1999, where Doctor Bones was given the Soul Gem
by Queen Titania, despite the fact that the Enforcers had been working
to keep the Soul Gem away from Doctor Bones. The Faerie and Doctor
Bones had a common enemy in the Protectors, and so Doctor Bones’
next move was to use the Soul Gem to destroy the Protectors. He
did so systematically until only Carson Sykes, the Leader, remained.
By this point, however, the New World Force had tracked down the
Assailants in order to apprehend them. The ensuing fight killed
most of the Assailants and the Leader himself killed Doctor Bones
and then freed the rest of the Protectors from the Soul Gem. With
Doctor Bones and Talisman dead, the other members of the Assailants
were incarcerated.</p><p>Rob Scearce created the Assailants</p></section></conbody></concept>
