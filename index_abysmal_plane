<title>The Abysmal Plane</title>
<refbody><section><title>Dimension</title><p>The Abysmal Plane is
another dimension basically equivalent in size to the Mundane universe.
The plane follows magical laws of reality that are not definable
or measurable by earth- level technology. This means that pretty
much anything can happen there. The major difference between the
Abysmal and Mundane plane is that the Abysmal plane is controlled/ created
by the Abyssae. The Abyssae are uniformly ruled by negative emotions
- hate, vengeance, terror, etc., and as such, their domains tend
to reflect this. This is not to say that all of the plane is ‘bad’.
There are some places where the inhabitants seem to be just and
fair. However, due to the nature of the dimension, the inhabitants
will have unjustifiable quirks caused by a high background level
of negativity.</p><p>The Abysmal Plane is one of the places the
souls of humans travel to after their deaths. These souls have a
subconscious control over their environment. Sinners who believe
they should be punished for their transgressions, will cause themselves to
be tormented for all eternity. The Abyssae actively promote this
for their own amusement.</p><p>The travel value between Earth and
the Abysmal Plane is normally 8. This can be dramatically improved
if a sacrifice is performed by the traveler or summoner. Blood sacrifices
of virgin humans reduces the travel value to 1. Dimensional shift affects
this as normal.</p></section>
<section><title>History</title><p>The Abysmal Plane is known to
all living beings as a racial memory. Since time began, life has
feared this dimension of ‘evil’ and no organic being can escape
this fear. Many beings have.damned themselves for all eternity because
they fear the abyss so much that they end up committing sins while
fighting what they perceive as ‘evil’.</p><p>The Abysmal Plane is
home to such creatures as N’Gari (aka Terror), Wrath, Shi- Roth,
the Clowns for Crime, Gehenna’s Legion and Lucifer (aka Satan, the
Devil etc.). These beings have threatened Earth on many occasions
throughout all eternity.</p><p>In 1995, Carson Sykes was in the
Abysmal Plane when he manifested his full powers. The result was
very bad and he managed to destroy 42% of the Abysmal Plane, which
has since been rebuilt.</p><p>From 1995 to 1997, the were trapped
in the Abysmal Plane in a region known as Pandemonium (no relation
to Lucifer’s palace of the same name). Fortunately, this was not
located in the part that Carson Sykes destroyed.</p><p>In 2014,
the group known as the Offspring, travelled into the Abysmal Plane,
or more specifically, they travelled to the Christian Hell in search
of the Holy Grail. While in Hell they fought Pride, but were eventually
rescued by Lucifer, who returned them to the Mundane world.</p><p>Rob
Scearce originated the idea of the Abysmal Plane. Kel McKay, Loren
Davie and Adrienne Kent have all contributed to it.</p></section></refbody></reference>
